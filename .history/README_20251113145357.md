# Greek and Hebrew Tweaks for Emacs

Emacs configuration for working with Biblical Greek and Hebrew text, including input method switching, dynamic cursor styling, and text utilities.

## Features

- **Alternative Input Method Switching**: Quick toggle between Hebrew (biblical-sil) and Greek (babel) input methods
- **Dynamic Cursor Styling**: Cursor automatically changes to a bar when near Greek/Hebrew text, box otherwise
- **Text Cleaning Utilities**: Remove verse numbers and brackets from Greek/Hebrew text
- **Font Configuration**: Optimized SBL BibLit font settings for Biblical languages

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download [greek-hebrew.el](greek-hebrew.el)
2. Add to your Emacs configuration:

```elisp
(load-file "/path/to/greek-hebrew.el")
```

Or copy the contents directly into your `init.el`.

## Usage

### Input Method Switching

- **Toggle Hebrew**: `C-\` (Control + backslash)
- **Toggle Greek**: `C-|` (Control + pipe/bar)
- **Insert Hard Break**: `C-x 8 f` (for Hebrew to English direction change)

The configuration uses:
- `hebrew-biblical-sil` for Biblical Hebrew
- `greek-babel` for Greek

To see available characters: `M-x describe-input-method`

### Text Cleaning

Select a region containing Greek or Hebrew text with verse numbers and brackets, then:

```
M-x strip-numbers-and-brackets
```

Or use the alias:

```
M-x grk
```

This removes all numbers, `[` and `]` characters from the selected region.

### Dynamic Cursor

The cursor automatically adjusts based on nearby text:
- **Bar cursor** (2px width): When within 5 characters of Greek/Hebrew text
- **Box cursor**: For regular English text

This provides visual feedback about the current text context.

## Font Requirements

This configuration uses the **SBL BibLit** font for optimal display of Biblical Greek and Hebrew.

### Installing SBL BibLit

1. Download from [SBL Fonts](https://www.sbl-site.org/resources/fonts/)
2. Install the font on your system
3. Restart Emacs

If you prefer a monospace font, edit [greek-hebrew.el](greek-hebrew.el) and uncomment:

```elisp
(set-fontset-font "fontset-default" 'greek (font-spec :family "Liberation Mono"))
```

## Configuration

Both Greek and Hebrew use consistent font settings in [greek-hebrew.el](greek-hebrew.el):

```elisp
(set-fontset-font "fontset-default" 'greek (font-spec :family "SBL BibLit" :size 20))
(set-fontset-font "fontset-default" 'hebrew (font-spec :family "SBL BibLit" :size 20))
```

Adjust the `:size` value to your preference.

## Sample Files

This repository includes two sample Greek text PDFs for testing:

- **[platonis-rempublicam-slings.pdf](platonis-rempublicam-slings.pdf)**: Plato's Republic in Greek (Slings edition)
- **[The Tyndale House Greek New Testament (2020, Crossway).pdf](The%20Tyndale%20House%20Greek%20New%20Testament%20(2020,%20Crossway).pdf)**: The Greek New Testament (Tyndale House edition)

These files are useful for testing the Greek input methods, font display, and text cleaning utilities.
